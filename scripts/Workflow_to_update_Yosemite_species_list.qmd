A workflow to maintain an up-to-date

## Download iNaturalist data

1.  go to inaturalist.org
2.  select `Explore` and `Phylum Tracheophyta` (vascular plants)
3.  Under filters, select `Research Grade`
4.  Under "more filters" select `Place = Yosemite National Park`
5.  Select `Download`
6.  Ensure you select the column `taxon_species_name`
7.  download the data, extract (if necessary) and ensure it is saved as a `.csv` file in a folder `data`

## Download Yosemite voucher data via the California Consortium of Herbaria (CCH2)

1.  go to inaturalist.org
2.  select `Explore` and `Phylum Tracheophyta` (vascular plants)
3.  Under filters, select `Research Grade`
4.  Under "more filters" select `Place = Yosemite National Park`
5.  Select `Download`
6.  Ensure you select the column `taxon_species_name`
7.  download the data, extract (if necessary) and ensure it is saved as a `.csv` file in a folder `data`

## Open libraries, read in files

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(data.table)

# read in iNaturalist records
iNat_records <- read_csv("data/iNat_records_download.csv")

# read in CCH2 records

# read in the taxonomy lookup table generated for this project, documenting all synonyms/misapplication/etc for Yosemite vouchers
CCH_synonyms <- read_csv("data_Yosemite/Yosemite_synonyms_lookup_2024.06.11.csv") %>%
  distinct(starting_name, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  rename(CCH_synonym = current_name)



```

```{r}

# read in Yosemite shapefile
yos <- st_read("data_Yosemite/Yosemite.kml")

# set 
yos_sf <- st_transform(yos, crs = 4326)
yos_simp <- st_make_valid(yos_sf) %>% st_polygonize
```

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
