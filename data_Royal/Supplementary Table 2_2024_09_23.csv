"Two vouchers from Royal, 1986 and 1992, both identified as E. obtusiflora. This species is restricted to WA, so it's not that, but what is it? The logical answer would probably be E. dendormorpha, which does occur in eastern Australia, as it was previously a subspecies of obtusiflora (= E. obtusiflora subsp. dendromorpha). However, there are no other records of dendromorpha from Royal, and this area generally seems to be out of range. So I'm not confident enough to assign this to dendromorpha for sure.

"The result of a very strange database error in the ALA/AVH. There are apparently five vouchers of this species in Royal, but none of them are that taxon. All of them are intergrades between other eucalypt taxa already noted from Royal (haemastoma, scias etc), but for whatever bizarre reason, when the supplied value of 'Eucalyptus' entered the ALA for each record, it then got converted into Eucalyptus pauciflora subsp. debeuzevillei. This esoteric subspecies now has thousands of records from around Australia due to this bug. Here is the explanation from Cameron Slatyer when I raised this with him: ""The problem specifically relates to RBG Sydney. They have all their intergrade specimens tagged ""Eucalyptus"" as the species and ""species"" as the rank. The names matching has a problem with a genus being expressed as a species and basically goes looking for a homonym. Now in the major of genera, it won't find one and therefore goes to a higher match. But in Eucalyptus, because the genus author is L'Herr, it seems cause some weirdness that makes it look to Eucalyptus pauciflora subsp. debeuzevillei. Curiously this happens in the other genera that have a apostrophe in the author name and incorrectly attributed species within the genera (it's rare but it does happen)""",Eucalyptus pauciflora,Eucalyptus pauciflora,current,Myrtaceae,3.dicot,out-of-range,,,1,,,,,,,,,"XX-not in iNat, not in park","XX-not on parks list, not in park","remove, listing based on database error",(disagree with voucher),,,,,

"the 1899 voucher is interesting location-wise. The locality was only given at the time as 'Heathcote'. There have been a lot of these thus far, ie 1800s/early 1900s vouchers with location given only as Heathcote, and they have generally all been geolocated on the Royal side of Heathcote. I have accepted all of these as legitimate locations given they are effectively non-falsifiable. For this particular record, however, someone has written in pencil on the sheet a set of coordinates (who, when, totally unclear, wasn't the collector though); when searching them, it geolocates the voucher just outside of Royal, into the middle of a suburban backyard just on the western edge. Given this pencil annotation was clearly not made by the original collector, I have no idea on what basis those coordinates were produced (the spot doesn't even seem to correspond to a notable landmark or the centroid of anywhere), so I am disregarding them for now",Jacksonia scoparia,Jacksonia scoparia,current,Fabaceae,3.dicot,native,,,1,,,1,,1,,,1," XX-not in iNat, yes in park","not on parks list, but occurs in park",retain voucher,old_vouchers_only,1899,1899,none,,

Sublyrata is the common Lagenophora species I've found in Royal, and there are no records (iNat or voucher) of stipitata in there. More importantly is the historical precedent of the name Lagenophora stipitata being widely used to refer to what is now recognised as sublyrata (via the original combination for sublyrata, Ixauchenus sublyratus, being synonymised under L. stipitata).

A good spotting character for the two when in flower is the inner surface of the calyx; glabrous in parviflorum and hairy for ferrugineum. It's a bit difficult to make out, not the sharpest photo, but zooming in on the iNat images the calyces look to be hairy on the inner surfaces. Vouchers are good though, collected by Carol Wilkins.

"there's apparently a 1770 voucher from inside the park, but this is an error due to a systemic error that occurs for some records provided by BioNet, so I've discarded it. For the correct voucher from in Royal, it is most likely an old one given the lack of date (and it was identified in June 1990, so if it was new, would've had to have been observed in those first few months of 1990). However, coordinates are probably wrong; there's an annotation on the record from Lawrie Johnson, one of the identifiers, which says ""[But is it from there? prob. not. LJ.]"".

"This one was an intriguing case. I was immediately sceptical of this listing. All vouchers terminate at around Botany Bay north of Royal, and indeed Halford and Henderson's 2003 revision of Pseudanthus lists Botany Bay as the southern limit of the species. Interestingly there are some flora survey records of it (many/most by David Keith) in Dharawal NP, but the only record at all of this species in Royal is a 1966 observation (no voucher). On this record in the ALA, there's a reference to a publication called 'Notes on the vascular plants of the Uloola Track. The Royal National Park' by B. Benn and J.G. McKern 1966. It was published in the journal Australian Wild Life, in volume 5, pages 4-30. I visited the NSW State Library and got a copy of the article. In their entire 400+ species list, P. orientalis is not listed whatsoever, the only Pseudanthus species is P. pimeleoides. So clearly this particular record is in error, and P. orientalis was certainly not recorded in Royal by this survey. I'll also note that on the record in the ALA, under the Location Remarks field, there is a comment reading ""ADDITIONAL SPECIES LIST COVENY (1975 - 1980),Only makes sense when included with blunderbuss.,LOCATION 102 ROYAL NATIONAL PARK NEW SOUTH WALES BENN AND MCKERN (1966),no separate communities,split into alliances,7070,Sclerophyllous Communities"". I can't really parse the meaning of this caveat without what is obviously necessary background context (what is blunderbuss? A location? Where is 'location 102'?), but it seems like this comment casts some doubt on this record. Regardless, I do not view it as reliable. However, I mentioned this record to John Arney, who let me know that ""I have just had a look at some of my reference notes and note that the late Pat Akkersdyk, (1919- 1994, 74yrs), has Pseudanthus orientalis listed for the ""Curra Moors to Curracurang Walk"" in 1982;   ""The Wises Track"" (no date);  and the ""Flat-Rock Crossing and South West Arm Creek Area"" (Two specific dates are mentioned for this one ""22/9/1979 and 11/12/1979"")"".

"numerous vouchers geolocated into ocean but clearly in Royal based on notes. The 1992 voucher at Flat Rock Creek in the middle of the park is the only voucher from Royal where it is not immediately clear whether it is actually speciosa or oppositiflora because dichotoma was the original supplied name. However, it is easy to assign this record to oppositiflora based on habitat. In Jobson and Baleeiro 2020, speciosa is described as  ""restricted to wallum swamps and lagoons on the central and mid-northern coast of New South Wales...A subaquatic species often found in the deeper areas of swamps"", ie the Jibbon Swamp location, which is the only known location for speciosa in Royal. Conversely, oppositiflora is described as inhabiting ""shallow seasonal swamps and depressions, and creek-lines in moist heathland"", ie the exact habitat at Flat Rock Creek. I am assigning the park listing of dichotoma to oppositiflora for this reason too; all of the old records (pre-recognition that speciosa and oppositiflora needed to be resurrected out of dichotoma) of dichotoma in Royal, including both the 1992 voucher and various other observational records from surveys, are all from the middle of Royal in oppositiflora habitat, with none from Jibbon.
